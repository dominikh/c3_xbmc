            There are hundreds, if not thousands, of news articles and blog posts about the BlackHole Exploit Kit. Usually, each story covers only a very narrow part of the subject matter. This talk will summarize the history of the BlackHole Exploit Kit into one easy to follow story. There will be diagrams and flow-charts for explaining code, rather than a giant blob of illegible Javascript, PHP, or x86 Assembly.
