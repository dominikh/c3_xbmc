        This lecture gives an introduction to processor design.
It is mostly interesting for people new to processor design and does not cover high performance pipelined structures.
Small knowledge on VHDL programming would be great but is not essential. A very small processor core will described here.
Demo:

Create a backdoor in the VHDL Code of a processor core.
Exploit this backdoor to get a root shell in the linux operating system.
