            Mobile networks should protect users on several fronts: Calls need to be encrypted, customer data protected, and SIM cards shielded from malware.

Many networks are still reluctant to implement appropriate protection measures in legacy systems. But even those who add mitigations often fail to fully capture attacks: They target symptoms instead of solving the core issue.

This talks discusses mobile network and SIM card attacks that circumvent common protection techniques to illustrate the ongoing mobile attack evolution.
