        Side-channel analysis (SCA) and related methods exploit physical characteristics of a (cryptographic) implementations to bypass security mechanisms and extract secret keys. Yet, SCA is often considered a purely academic exercise with no impact on real systems. In this talk, we show that this is not the case: Using the example of several wide-spread real-world devices, we demonstrate that even seemingly secure systems can be attacked by means of SCA with limited effort.
