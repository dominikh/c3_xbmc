        You might remember Tamagotchi virtual pets from the 1990's. These toys are still around and just as demanding as ever! At 29C3, I talked about my attempts to reverse engineer the latest Tamagotchis, and this presentation covers my progress since then. It includes methods for executing code on and dumping code from a Tamagotchi, an analysis of the Tamagotchi code dump and a demonstration of Tamagotchi development tools that make use of these capabilities.
