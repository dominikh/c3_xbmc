        Did you ever feel the need to be in charge of your environment? We did . A detailed story of our experience playing with 220VAC and water to build an automated, digitally controlled ecosystem. A place, where you can be the climate-change. Double the temperature, triple the floods, let it storm or rain. A Tamagotchi that generates food from electricity. All done with Arduino, raspberry Pi and Node.js.
