        In this lecture Julian will introduce projects and interventions made by himself and others that foreground Engineering, rather than Art, in the creative and critical frame, offering highly public insights into the hidden mechanisms and power struggles within our technical environment. Projects such as the <i>Transparency Grenade</i>, <i>Packetbruecke</i> and <i>Newstweek</i> will be covered in detail.
