        The brain can be understood as a highly specialized information processing device. Because computers basically do the same thing, it's not too absurd to try to link these two together. The result is a brain-computer-interface.
This talk explains the core functionality of our brain and how to access the stored data from the outside. Software and hardware have already reached a somewhat hacker-friendly state, and we want to show you how we got there. We're also here to answer all your questions about the brain.
