            Knight-Mozilla OpenNews sends coders into news organisations on a ten-month fellowship to make new tools for reporting and measuring the news. We believe that to remain relevant, journalism has to smarten up about tech and data. As a global community, we develop tools to datamine public data, news apps to make information accessible, and visualisations to break down complex stories. In my talk, I want to present the lessons about tech that I've learned in a newsroom and the things that still need to be built.
